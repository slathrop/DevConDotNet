# DevConDotNet
Sample command-line interface implementation for an ASP.NET website (i.e., a "Web CLI") based on example by CSaloio.

## Browser Requirements
Note that this sample assumes that you are using a browser that supports:

- ES6 [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class#Browser_compatibility)
- The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Browser_compatibility)

So basically, an up-to-date version of Chrome or Firefox is required.

## How to Try It
Load the solution in Visual Studio (say, VStudio 2015 Community Edition) and then:

- Press F5 to run the site in Debug mode
- With the site running in Chrome or Firefox, press `Shift+Ctrl+Backquote` to open the CLI
- Enter the `help` command and press `Enter` to see a list of available sample commands
